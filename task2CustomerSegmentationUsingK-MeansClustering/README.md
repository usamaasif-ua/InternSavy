🔍 Exploring Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering 🔍

Excited to share my recent Data Science project where I delved into customer segmentation using K-Means clustering! 📊🎯

Project Overview:
I had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project that aimed to segment customers based on their spending behavior and annual income. Leveraging Machine Learning and various data analysis libraries, I embarked on a journey to uncover meaningful insights from the dataset.

Key Steps and Highlights:
📊 Data Preprocessing: After loading the Mall_Customers dataset, I began by removing redundant features and performing a quick overview to understand its structure.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations played a pivotal role in gaining insights into relationships between various features. I used seaborn for box plots, scatter plots, and even a pair plot to uncover intriguing patterns.

🤖 Model Building: I chose K-Means clustering to segment customers based on spending score and annual income. This involved fitting the algorithm, predicting clusters, and visualizing the results.

📈 Preprocessing with Min-Max Scaler: To ensure an unbiased clustering process, I applied Min-Max scaling to the features.

🔄 Re-running K-Means: After scaling, I re-ran the K-Means algorithm and visualized the clusters again to observe any changes.

💡 Elbow Plot for Optimal Clusters: To determine the optimal number of clusters, I created an elbow plot, helping me make an informed decision.

Why Customer Segmentation Matters:
By uncovering distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, offer personalized experiences, and optimize resource allocation. This data-driven approach can lead to enhanced customer engagement and satisfaction.

I'm thrilled with the insights I've gained from this project and the potential impact it could have on businesses aiming to understand their customers better. 🚀
