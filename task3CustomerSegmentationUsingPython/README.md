I'm thrilled to share some of the recent milestones from our data segmentation project. In this endeavor, we aimed to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences using the following dataset attributes:

- **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier
- **Gender**: Customer's gender
- **Age**: Customer's age
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Customer's annual income
- **Spending Score (1-1000)**: Mall-assigned spending score

## Project Highlights:

### Data Preprocessing:
We started by importing essential libraries and performing data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, renaming columns, and exploring the dataset's characteristics.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Our exploration revealed intriguing patterns:
- The age group near 30-40 showed the highest density.
- Most customers had an income in the range of 50-80k.
- The majority of customers had a spending score around 50.

We also used visualizations to dive deeper into gender distribution, age, income, and spending score.

### Model Building:
We applied k-means clustering to segment our data into meaningful groups. Here's a snapshot of our progress:

#### 1. K-Means Clustering based on Spending Score and Annual Income:
We identified 5 clusters using the elbow method. This approach helps us better understand customer spending habits in relation to their annual income.

#### 2. K-Means Clustering based on Spending Score and Age:
We determined 4 clusters using the elbow method, providing insights into customer behavior based on age and spending score.

Our model-building efforts culminated in visually striking cluster representations, showcasing the unique characteristics of each group.

This project has given us invaluable insights into our customers' behavior, enabling us to tailor our services more effectively. Stay tuned for more updates as we dive deeper into these clusters and extract actionable recommendations.


Let's continue exploring and refining our insights to serve our customers better! 💡📊🛍️
